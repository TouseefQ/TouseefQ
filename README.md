I am currently enrolled as a Master's student at Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg with a solid background in Mechatronics Engineering. Over the years, I have honed skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving, and I have become a quick learner who is able to adapt to diverse and fast-paced environments. My experience in development has allowed me to develop excellent coding skills and keen attention to detail. I'm passionate about exploring new, advanced technologies and am always eager to learn. I pride myself as a team player who is able to collaborate and communicate effectively with a diverse range of professionals.
